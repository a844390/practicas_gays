Preguntas de la Práctica 1
1. In an ELF binary, what is the difference between sections and segments?
In an ELF binary, sections describe the logical organization of the program (such as code, data, or uninitialized variables) and are mainly used by the compiler and linker during build time, 
while segments describe how the program should be laid out in memory at runtime and are used by the loader. Sections provide a fine-grained view of the program’s contents, whereas segments group 
one or more sections into larger regions that are actually loaded into memory for execution.

2. Can an ELF binary have several loadable segments?
Yes, an ELF binary can have several loadable segments. This is common practice, for example having one loadable segment for executable code and read-only data and another for writable data and 
uninitialized memory. Each loadable segment has its own virtual address range and size, allowing different parts of the program to be mapped into memory with appropriate layout and protections.
